# Eddy Coherence ML

Machine learning framework for identifying and predicting Lagrangian coherent eddies in the Gulf of Mexico using satellite observations. This repository provides access to trained models described in our paper that predict Loop Current Eddies (LCEs) and Loop Current Frontal Eddies (LCFEs).

## Overview

This work demonstrates how machine learning can *identify* and *predict* the lifetime of Lagrangian coherent eddies using multiple satellite observations:
- Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT)
- Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
- Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)

## Model Performance

Our models achieve significant accuracy in eddy identification and lifetime prediction:

### Loop Current Eddies (LCEs)
- 90% accuracy in identification
- 93% accuracy in lifetime prediction

### Loop Current Frontal Eddies (LCFEs)
- 71% accuracy in identification
- 61% accuracy in lifetime prediction

The integration of SST and Chl-a data improved predictions compared to using ADT alone, highlighting the value of incorporating Chl-a data into ocean models.

## Significance

Lagrangian coherent eddies play a crucial role in ocean dynamics by transporting:
- Heat and salt
- Oil (as demonstrated during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill)
- Marine larvae
- Sargassum

This research investigates eddy coherence at three different durations: 5, 10, and 20 days.
